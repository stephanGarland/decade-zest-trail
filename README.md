# decade-zest-trail
A riff on a popular board game of a suspiciously similar name. Please don't sue me.

I'm going to attempt to make this using https://github.com/jkomoros/boardgame as the framework. It's partially a Go exercise, but also I dearly love this game (well, the inspiration) and really want to be able to play it online. Looking at you, BGA.

I also think it would be cool to render the game with ASCII art, so that might be something I look into in parallel.
